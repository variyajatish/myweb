    <p>Pikachu was designed around the concept of electricity.They are creatures that have short, yellow fur with brown markings covering their backs and parts of their lightning bolt-shaped tails. They have black-tipped, pointed ears and red circular pouches on their cheeks, which can spark with electricity.They attack primarily by projecting electricity from their bodies at their targets.Within the context of the franchise, Pikachu can transform, or "evolve," into a Raichu when exposed to a "Thunder Stone."Pikachu was originally planned to have a second evolution called Gorochu, which was intended to be the evolved form of Raichu.In Pokémon Gold and Silver, "Pichu" was introduced as an evolutionary predecessor to Pikachu.In Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, gender differences were introduced; since those games, female Pikachu have an indent at the end of their tails, giving the tail a heart-shaped appearance.</p>
